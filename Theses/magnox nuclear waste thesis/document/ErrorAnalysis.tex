As outlined in \cref{Introduction Section}, the proposal of a new design for a storage container for high and low level radioactive waste is that of theoretical design. This project relied heavily on research and design though error calculations could've been constructed through a random size model of the proposed design internal volume but due to the ability to have varied specification the error analysis does not support any evidence found. \\

Further analysis would focus highly on penetration levels for different materials and how the honeycomb structure stand against potential common hazard currently faced in the life cycle of nuclear waste. The size and measurement of the side plates and honeycomb structure will have to be cutting to strict tolerances as to provide a airtight seal in each joint so to avoid water infiltration.
