abstract = "Radio waves have been the standard method for deep-space communications since the earliest days of space exploration. However, the recent success of the Lunar Laser Communications Demonstration (LLCD) program will clearly revolutionize the way data is sent and received from deep space. LLCD demonstrated record-breaking optical up/downlinks between Earth and the Lunar Lasercom Space Terminal (LLST) payload on NASA׳s Lunar Atmosphere Environment Explorer (LADEE) satellite orbiting the Moon. A space-to-ground optical downlink as fast as 622Mbps was demonstrated as well as a ground-to-space uplink as fast as 20Mbps. The LLCD operations architecture was designed to support a wide range of operations conditions, multiple ground terminals with varying designs and capabilities, short contact times including energy and thermal constraints, and limited viewing opportunities. This paper will explore the operations architecture used for the LLCD as well as present ideas on how best to make future laser communications operations routine and suitable for wide-scale deployment."

abstract = {The influence of mass spectrometry is far-reaching! In this issue of the Journal of Mass Spectrometry, Authors Arevalo, Ni and Danell describe the rich history and promising future applications of the mass spectrometer in the investigation of planetary bodies. Mass analyzers sent into space and deployed to planetary bodies are inherently different from the instruments used in a conventional laboratory setting. Payload instruments must be small and especially rugged, so that they survive the launch, cruise, and deployment phases of the mission. They must also provide a specific set of analytical objectives, including sensitive and quantitative measurements of chemical composition, and isotopic, elemental, and molecular abundances of both volatile and nonvolatile components. These systems must operate autonomously and provide unbiased information on planetary materials. In this month's Special Feature the authors discuss instrument types, their operational requirements, and highlight the expanding scope of mass spectrometry in interplanetary studies.},

It has become an essential analytical tool in biological research and can be used to characterize a wide variety of biomolecules such as sugars, proteins, and oligonucleotides. In this review, a brief history of mass spectrometry is discussed, and the basic principles of the technology are introduced. A summary of some current applications is provided, as are examples of recently published research. The current methods used to identify, quantify, and characterize proteins and peptides are then reviewed. The range of applications of mass spectrometry is considerable and only promises to grow as the technology continues to improve.},
